# ZeekQuota
WIP--Scripts to help enforce compliance with ISP data caps. 

Currently requires the use of Bro/Zeek for monitoring; which will need to be installed prior to use of this script.

Note: I am still very much a beginner when it comes to coding; these files should not be used in your enviornment without extensive testing, validation, and understanding of the code.
Respectful suggestions for improvement are welcome! (But, I have many other obligations, so I cannot guarantee any kind of timeframe for response.) :)
Created with the assitance of various AI/ML tools (e.g. ChatGPT).
